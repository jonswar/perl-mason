=head1 NAME

Mason::Component - Mason Component base class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every Mason component corresponds to a unique class that inherits, directly or
indirectly, from this base class.

A new instance of the component class is created whenever a component is called
- whether via a top level request, C<< <& &> >> tags, or an << $m->comp >>
call. A component instance is only valid for the Mason request in which it was
created.

We leave this class as devoid of built-in methods as possible, allowing you to
create methods in your own components without worrying about name clashes.

=head1 STRUCTURAL METHODS

This is the standard call chain for the page component (the initial component
of a request).

    handle -> render -> wrap -> main

In many cases only C<main> will actually do anything.

=over

=item handle

This is the top-most method called on the page component. Its job is to decide
how to handle the request, e.g.

=over

=item *

throw an error (e.g. permission denied)

=item *

take some action and redirect (e.g. if handling a form in a web environment)

=item *

defer to another component via C<< $m->go >>

=item *

render the page

=back

It should not output any content itself. By default, it simply calls
L<render|/render>.

=item render

This method is invoked from L<handle|/handle> on the page component. Its job is
to output the full content of the page. By default, it simply calls
L<wrap|/wrap>.

=item wrap

This method is invoked from L<render|/render> on the page component.  By
convention, C<wrap> is an L<augmented|Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers/INNER AND
AUGMENT> method, with each superclass calling the next subclass.  This is
useful for cascading templates in which the top-most superclass generates the
surrounding content.

    <%augment wrap>
      <h3>Subtitle section</h3>
      <div class="main">
        <% inner() %>
      </div>
    </%augment>

By default, C<wrap> simply calls C<< inner() >> to go to the next subclass, and
then L<main|/main> at the bottom subclass.

To override a component's parent wrapper, a component can define its own
C<wrap> using C<method> instead of C<augment>:

    <%method wrap>
      <h3>Parent wrapper will be ignored</h3>
      <% inner() %>
    </%method>

To do no wrapping at all, call the component class method L</no_wrap>:

    <%class>
    CLASS->no_wrap;
    </%class>

=item main

This method is invoked when a non-page component is called, and from the
default L<wrap|/wrap> method as well. It consists of the code and output in the
main part of the component that is not inside a C<< <%method> >> or C<<
<%class> >> tag.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item no_wrap

A convenience method that redefines L<render|/render> to call L<main|/main>
instead of L<wrap|/wrap>, thus skipping any content wrapper inherited from
parent.

    <%class>
    CLASS->no_wrap;
    </%class>

=item allow_path_info

This method is called when the request path has a path_info portion, to
determine whether the path_info is allowed. Default is false. See
L<Mason::Manual::RequestDispatch/Partial Paths|Mason::Manual::RequestDispatch>.

    <%class>
    method allow_path_info { 1 }
    </%class>

=back

=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over

=item args

Returns the hashref of arguments passed to this component's constructor, e.g.
the arguments passed in a L<component call|/CALLING COMPONENTS>.

=item cmeta

Returns the L<Mason::Component::ClassMeta> object associated with this
component class, containing information such as the component's path and source
file.

    my $path = $self->cmeta->path;

=item m

Returns the current request. This is also available via C<< $m >> inside Mason
components.

=back

=cut
